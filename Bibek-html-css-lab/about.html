      <h2>What you need to know about spa!</h2>

      <p>
        A spa is a location where mineral-rich spring water (and sometimes seawater) is used to give medicinal baths.
        Spa towns or spa resorts (including hot springs resorts) typically offer various health treatments, which are
        also known as balneotherapy. The belief in the curative powers of mineral waters goes back to prehistoric times.

      <h3 id="origins">Origins of the term</h3>
      <p>
        The term is derived from the name of the town of Spa, Belgium, whose name is known back from Roman times,
        when the location was called Aquae Spadanae, sometimes incorrectly connected to the Latin word spargere
        meaning to scatter, sprinkle or moisten. The word spa itself denotes "fountain".
      </p>

      <h3 id="treatments">Treatments</h3>
      <p>
        A 'body treatment', 'spa treatment', or 'cosmetic treatment' is a non-medical procedure to help the health of
        the body. It is often performed at a resort, destination spa, day spa, beauty salon or school.
      </p>

      <h3 id="recent">Recent trends</h3>
      <p>
        In the modern world spa therapies are linked to beauty, pampering, indulgence, and health. The spa industry
        continues to grow and embrace wellness as its core business.
